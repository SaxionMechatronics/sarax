  <string id="%10%" value="Locational transition fits\nCompromise between clearance and interference fits.\nUsed for application where accuracy of location is important."/>
  <string id="%11%" value="Locational Interference fits\nUsed where accuracy of location is prime importance.\nNot inteded  for parts designed to transmit functional loads from\none part to another by virtue of the tightness of fit."/>
