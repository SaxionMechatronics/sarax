## Contribution Guidelines for Sarax GitHub Repository

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the Sarax project! To ensure a smooth and collaborative experience for everyone involved, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to freely make changes without affecting the main project.

### 2. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch

```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Make your modifications in the newly created branch. Ensure that your code follows the existing style and conventions used in the project.

### 4. Test Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, please test them thoroughly. Ensure that any new features are working as expected and that existing functionality is not broken.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Use clear and concise commit messages to describe your changes. Follow this format for your commit messages:

```
[Type]: Brief description of the change

```

Types can include:

- **Fix**: A bug fix.
- **Feature**: A new feature.
- **Docs**: Changes to documentation.
- **Style**: Formatting changes (no code changes).
- **Refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.

### 6. Push to Your Fork

Once youâ€™ve made and committed your changes, push them to your fork:

```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch

```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

Navigate to the original repository and open a pull request (PR) from your branch. In the PR description, explain your changes, the rationale behind them, and any relevant context.

### 8. Engage in the Review Process

Be responsive to feedback and suggestions from the project maintainers. Make any necessary adjustments to your code based on their comments.
